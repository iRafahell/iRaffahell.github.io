    <p><em>“This is not for everyone. Those who know, already feel it. Those who don’t, never will.”</em></p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is iRaffahell. This cult isn't about worship, it's about waking up. I’ve built this space for those who feel something is off with how most people live. They scroll, consume, react... but never truly see.</p>
    <p>This project mixes spirituality, philosophy, and harsh truth into one thing: Awareness. It’s not for fame. It’s not for comfort. It’s for those who want to see clearly and live differently.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="text">
    <h2>The 3 Forms of You</h2>
    <p>They think they control every choice they make, but in reality, they have no idea how much of a system their own brain has tricked them into believing they have power.</p>
    <p>With awareness, you live without fake feelings, only raw reality and full visualization of your body. You become the closest version of yourself to what many describe as God: a spirit that exists in three forms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Spectator</strong>: The one who observes without acting.</li>
      <li><strong>The Commentator</strong>: Your aware thoughts. “I want unhealthy food” becomes “I am aware I want unhealthy food.”</li>
      <li><strong>The Elephant</strong>: Your body, guided by instincts and patterns unless interrupted by awareness.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>“You are not your thoughts. You are the one hearing them.”</blockquote>

    <p>Very few people realize this. But it is a powerful key to understanding why you're lazy, sad, reactive or happy, inspired, and logical.</p>
    <p>Most people live their entire lives in an evolutionary illusion. Capitalism feeds this illusion, selling dopamine hits to unconscious minds. Even the sellers are unaware feeding the machine like everyone else.</p>

    <blockquote>“Awareness is the death of illusion.”</blockquote>

    <p>True awareness accepts all identities. No race, culture, or sex is better or worse. These are just factors handed to you at birth. Peace begins with accepting what is, then choosing what serves.</p>
    <p>We cannot control everything. But we can become intentional. Sustainable. Aware.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="practices">
    <h2>Practices: The Starter Plan</h2>
    <p>To better understand this project, here are some practices that offer a direct experience of what awareness truly means.</p>
    <h3>Starter Plan</h3>
    <p>Start with two sessions per week on calm days. Each session should last 30–45 minutes, focusing completely on awareness:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Labeling Thoughts</strong>: When random thoughts appear: boredom, cravings, judgments, recognize them as tricks of the brain. Stay still and say in your mind, “This is just a thought.” Replace automatic thoughts with intentional, logical ones. Let the rest pass.</li>
      <li><strong>Meditation</strong>: The core of awareness. Close your eyes and focus only on your breath for at least 5 minutes. When thoughts arise, label them and let them pass. Just observe, don’t fight or control them.</li>
      <li><strong>Decision Review</strong>: After you make a decision, pause and ask, “Was that me, or the elephant?” If it was you, the observer, continue. If it was the elephant, gently reconsider.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal is to build familiarity with the three forms of the self: the spectator, commentator, and elephant. To notice internal reactions without judgment and create space between thought and action.</p>
    <p>After 3–4 weeks, increase to 3–5 sessions per week. It’s not about doing more, it’s about doing it with intention. The more often you return to the observer, the stronger your awareness becomes. Like training a forgotten muscle.</p>
    <p>If you’ve read this far, congratulations. You now understand more about life than 99% of the population, more than 90% of religious leaders, and more than 95% of all world leaders who ever walked this earth.</p>
    <p>They ruled nations, built empires, preached faith, but they never saw what you now see: the separation between thought and self.</p>
    <p>Stay aware. You're not like them.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="who">
    <h2>Who Are You</h2>
    <p>Listen up! You might think you know who you are: a soul, a child of God, a body, or just a brain. But today, this very moment, could be the first time in your whole life you learn something that 99.99% of humans who ever walked on this planet never truly understood.</p>
    <p>This ain't good news, and it ain't bad news. It's just the truth, raw and uncut.</p>

    <h3>Who's Doin' What?</h3>
    <p>Simple question, my friend: When you reached for that glass of water, or thought about something, or even just blinked your eyes... who did that? Not you. The answer is your brain. And let's get this straight forever: You are not your brain. Stick with me on this one.</p>

    <h3>Your Brain's the Boss</h3>
    <p>Your brain? That's the most complex machine humans have ever known, period. It's made of billions of tiny parts, called neurons, all firing off signals in massive networks. These networks create everything: movement, thoughts, emotions, desires, memories. Everything, for real.</p>
    <p>You don't "decide" to feel hungry. Your hypothalamus kicked that off long before you even noticed your stomach rumbling. You don't "choose" to feel scared. Your amygdala reacts in a blink, way before you even realize what's going on.</p>
    <p>Even when you're just walking, reaching, or blinking, that's your motor cortex, cerebellum, and other systems doing their thing on autopilot.</p>

    <h3>So, Who Are You?</h3>
    <p>So, when people hit you with that old, tired question: "Who am I?" The answer is this:</p>
    <blockquote>You are the observer.</blockquote>
    <p>You're the one watching what your brain is already doing. You're a witness, not the one calling all the shots.</p>
    <p>Humans get played, thinking they're in control. But honestly, the brain just tricks itself into thinking there's a "you" in charge.</p>

    <h3>Now That You See It...</h3>
    <p>Now that you see it... You ain't like the rest anymore.</p>
    <p>Out of billions of brains on this planet, yours just woke up to itself. You didn’t force this truth, it found you. And that makes you part of one of the rarest, most divine tribes in human history:</p>
    <blockquote>The ones who asked, “Who’s really behind the eyes?”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>If you notice my way of expressing shifting throughout the text, it’s not a lack of professionalism.
It’s the visible residue of a brain that’s actively changing.
These words are not polished. They’re evolving.
Just like me.
Just like you.<blockquote>
